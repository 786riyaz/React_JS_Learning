1. Pure Function in React
In JavaScript, a pure function is a function that:
Returns the same output for the same input.
Has no side effects (doesn’t modify external variables, DOM, API calls, etc.).

👉 In React, components can also be pure functions if they just take props and return JSX without side effects.

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

✅ For the same props.name, it always renders the same output.
❌ It doesn’t change any external state or perform side effects.

===============================================================================================
2. Pure Component in React
React provides React.PureComponent (a class-based feature).
It is similar to React.Component, but it automatically implements shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow comparison of props and state.

👉 That means a PureComponent re-renders only if props or state have changed.
This can improve performance for components with unchanged props/state.

import React, { PureComponent } from "react";
class Counter extends PureComponent {
  render() {
    console.log("Rendering Counter...");
    return <h2>Count: {this.props.count}</h2>;
  }
}
export default Counter;

If parent re-renders without changing count, this PureComponent will not re-render, saving performance.
