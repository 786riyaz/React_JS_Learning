🔹 What is use API in React?
The use API is not like hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.).
It’s a new experimental API that lets you unwrap promises or contexts directly inside components.

If you pass a Promise to use(), React will automatically:
    Suspend the component until the promise resolves.
    Resume rendering once the data is available.
    If the promise rejects → it throws an error React can catch with an error boundary.

If you pass a context (like MyContext), use(MyContext) works like useContext(MyContext).


So, use is basically a universal data reader:
Reads async values (promises).
Reads context values.

==================================================================================================== 
🔹 Why is this powerful?
Normally you’d need useEffect + useState for data fetching.
With use(), React natively integrates async/await into rendering.
==================================================================================================== 
✅ In short:
The example shows how the use API lets you fetch data as a promise and directly consume it inside a component. React handles suspending the component until the data arrives, showing the Suspense fallback in the meantime.
