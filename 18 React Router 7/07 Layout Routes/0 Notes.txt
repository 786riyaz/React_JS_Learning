In React Router (v6 and above), layout routes are a way to share common UI (like a navigation bar, sidebar, or footer) across multiple pages without repeating the same code in every route.

Think of them as a "wrapper route" that renders shared components along with whichever child route is currently active.

🔹 How it Works
A layout route uses the <Outlet /> component.
<Outlet /> acts as a placeholder where nested child routes will be rendered.

🔹 How it Renders
Visiting / → Layout renders + Home inside <Outlet />.
Visiting /about → Layout renders + About inside <Outlet />.
Visiting /contact → Layout renders + Contact inside <Outlet />.
So Layout is always visible, and the content changes inside <Outlet />.

✅ In short:
Layout routes let you define a common page structure (header, sidebar, footer, etc.) and nest different pages inside it.
