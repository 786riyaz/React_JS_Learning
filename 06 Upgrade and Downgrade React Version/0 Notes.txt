New versions are required for new features

How to Check current version :::
in package.json file go to dependencies and see the version of "react" and "react-dom"

We can change the version in the package.json and hit the "npm install" command on terminal to download the relevant packages.
for the safer side you can delete the "node_module" folder before hitting the "npm install" command.

In your package.json line:
"react-dom": "^19.1.1"

the caret (^) means allow updates that do not change the leftmost non-zero number (the major version).

Specifically:
19.1.1 = major.minor.patch
major = 19
minor = 1
patch = 1

With ^19.1.1, npm (or yarn, pnpm) will install:
Anything from 19.1.1 up to, but not including, 20.0.0.

So:
✅ Allowed updates: 19.1.2, 19.2.0, 19.9.9, etc.
❌ Not allowed: 20.0.0 or higher (because that could include breaking changes).

🔹 Quick comparison:
"react-dom": "19.1.1" → lock to exactly 19.1.1.
"react-dom": "~19.1.1" → allow patch updates only (19.1.x, but not 19.2.0).
"react-dom": "^19.1.1" → allow minor + patch updates (19.x.x, but not 20.0.0).
