1. What is a Component in ReactJS?

-   A component is a reusable piece of UI in React.
-   It acts like a building block for web applications.
-   Each component can handle its own structure, logic, and styling.

Key Features: - Reusable → Use same component multiple times (e.g.,
button, header). - Independent → Works on its own, modular. - Composable
→ Combine small components to create larger UIs. - Maintainable →
Breaking UI into parts makes code easier to manage.

2. Types of Components
(1) Functional Components (Preferred way)
-   Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
-   Example:
        function Welcome(props) {
          return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
        }

        // Arrow function style
        const Welcome = ({ name }) => <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;

(2) Class Components (Older way)
-   Written using ES6 classes.
-   Can hold state and lifecycle methods.
-   Example:
        class Welcome extends React.Component {
          render() {
            return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}!</h1>;
          }
        }

3. Using a Component
    function App() {
      return (
        <div>
          <Welcome name="Riyaz" />
          <Welcome name="Khan" />
        </div>
      );
    }

-   Welcome is a component.
-   App is also a component.
-   name is a prop (data passed to the component).

4. Summary
-   A React component = a custom, reusable, self-contained UI block.
-   Works like your own HTML tag.
-   Helps build scalable and maintainable apps.

=============================================================================================

While sending a component means Exporting component
While using a companine means Importing a component

We can export multiple component from single JSX file
We can only export one component by default

Type of Export
  Default Export
  Named Export
  Multiple Export

Default Export can directly be imported without curly brackets 
export default Login();
import Login from "./UserComponent";

Named Export must be imported with curly brackets
export function Login() {
import {Login} from "./UserComponent";
