### Beginner-Level Questions (1–30)

Question 1 : What is React?
Answer : React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It uses a component-based approach and virtual DOM for efficient updates.

Question 2 : What are the key features of React?
Answer : Key features include virtual DOM for performance, JSX for syntax, reusable components, unidirectional data flow, and server-side rendering support.

Question 3 : What is JSX?
Answer : JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows writing HTML-like code in React. It compiles to React.createElement calls for better readability.

Question 4 : What is the virtual DOM?
Answer : Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory representation of the real DOM. React uses it to compute minimal updates, improving performance over direct DOM manipulation.

Question 5 : What are components in React?
Answer : Components are reusable, independent pieces of UI code. They can be functional (simple functions) or class-based (with state and lifecycle methods).

Question 6 : What is the difference between functional and class components?
Answer : Functional components are simpler functions returning JSX; class components extend React.Component and handle state/lifecycle. Hooks make functionals equivalent.

Question 7 : What are props in React?
Answer : Props are read-only inputs passed from parent to child components for data sharing. They are immutable and accessed via this.props in classes.

Question 8 : What is state in React?
Answer : State is mutable data managed within a component. It triggers re-renders when updated via setState or useState hook.

Question 9 : How do props differ from state?
Answer : Props are passed from parent and immutable; state is internal, mutable, and managed by the component itself.

Question 10 : What are keys in React?
Answer : Keys are unique identifiers for list items, helping React track changes efficiently without re-rendering the entire list.

Question 11 : What is the purpose of render() in React?
Answer : render() returns JSX describing the UI. It's called on state/prop changes and must be pure.

Question 12 : What are lifecycle methods in React?
Answer : Methods like componentDidMount (post-mount), componentDidUpdate (post-update), and componentWillUnmount (pre-unmount) manage component phases.

Question 13 : What is useState hook?
Answer : useState adds state to functional components, returning [value, setter]. Example: const [count, setCount] = useState(0).

Question 14 : What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?
Answer : Controlled components use React state for input values; uncontrolled rely on DOM via refs.

Question 15 : How do you handle events in React?
Answer : Use camelCase attributes like onClick, passing functions. Synthetic events wrap native ones for consistency.

Question 16 : What is a higher-order component (HOC)?
Answer : HOC is a function that takes a component and returns an enhanced one, enabling code reuse like authentication.

Question 17 : What is React Router?
Answer : A library for handling navigation in React apps, using components like `<Route>` for URL mapping.

Question 18 : What are hooks in React?
Answer : Hooks like useState and useEffect add state and lifecycle to functional components, introduced in React 16.8.

Question 19 : What is the useEffect hook?
Answer : Handles side effects like data fetching. Runs after render; dependencies control re-runs.

Question 20 : What is conditional rendering?

```
Answer : Use if-statements, ternary operators, or && to render based on conditions, e.g., `{isLoggedIn ? <Dashboard /> : <Login />}`.
```

Question 21 : What are fragments in React?
Answer : Fragments group elements without extra DOM nodes, using `<> </>` syntax.

Question 22 : What is PropTypes?
Answer : A library for type-checking props, ensuring correct data types during development.

Question 23 : What is the purpose of keys in lists?
Answer : Keys help React identify changed items, optimizing re-renders.

Question 24 : How do you create a React app?
Answer : Use create-react-app CLI: `npx create-react-app my-app`.

Question 25 : What is the difference between React and React Native?
Answer : React is for web UIs; React Native is for mobile apps using native components.

Question 26 : What is reconciliation in React?
Answer : The process of comparing virtual DOM trees to update the real DOM minimally.

Question 27 : What are pure components?
Answer : Components that optimize by shallow-comparing props/state to avoid unnecessary renders.

Question 28 : What is context in React?
Answer : Context shares data globally without prop drilling, using Provider and Consumer.

Question 29 : What are error boundaries?
Answer : Components catching errors in child trees, displaying fallback UI via componentDidCatch.

Question 30 : How do you optimize React performance?
Answer : Use memoization, code splitting, lazy loading, and avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### Intermediate-Level Questions (31–60)
