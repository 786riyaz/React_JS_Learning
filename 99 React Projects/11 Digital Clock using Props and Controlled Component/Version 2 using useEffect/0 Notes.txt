🔹 Why do we need useEffect?

Before hooks, React used lifecycle methods in class components (componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount).
useEffect replaces all of them in functional components.

⚡ Summary:

useEffect lets you run side effects in functional components.

Runs after render.

[] = run once.

[dep] = run when dep changes.

Cleanup function = avoid memory leaks.

👉 Do you want me to create a simple demo with a button and useEffect to show how it runs on mount, update, and cleanup?
