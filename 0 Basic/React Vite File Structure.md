React + Vite Project Structure Explained
========================================

1. node_modules/
    - Contains all dependencies (packages) installed using npm, such as React, ReactDOM, and Vite.
    - Managed automatically. Do not edit this folder.
    - Example: The code for all libraries installed for your project lives here.
2. public/
    - Stores static assets like images, fonts, and icons.
    - Files are copied as-is to the final build and available via direct paths (e.g., /logo.png).
    - Example: `public/logo.png` can be accessed at `http://localhost:5173/logo.png`.
3. src/
    - Main working folder for your React app: components, logic, styles, and custom modules.
    - Common subfolders and files:
a) assets/
        - Store images, icons, and other static files to import into React components.
        - Files here are processed and optimized by Vite.
b) components/
        - Reusable React UI elements (e.g., Button, Header).
c) features/
        - Organize files related to distinct features (e.g., authentication, products).
d) hooks/
        - Custom hooks to reuse logic (e.g., useAuth, useFetch).
e) pages/
        - Page components (views) such as Home.jsx, About.jsx.
f) layouts/
        - Layout components for structuring pages.
g) services/
        - API integrations or external service functions.
h) store/
        - Application-wide state management setup (Redux, Context).
i) styles/
        - Global CSS/SASS, theme management, variables.

Common files in src/:
---------------------
        - App.css: CSS for App component.
        - App.jsx: Main React component ("root component").
        - index.css: Global CSS file.
        - main.jsx: Entry point; renders the App component into <div id="root"></div> in index.html.
4. .gitignore
    - Lists files/folders to exclude from Git tracking, like node_modules and sensitive configs.
    - Keeps the repository clean and secure.
5. eslint.config.js
    - Configuration for ESLint, the code style/linting tool.
    - Enforces consistent style and helps catch errors before running the code.
6. index.html
    - The main HTML file, typically with a <div id="root"></div>.
    - React mounts your application in this div.
    - Minimal edits; mostly title, meta tags, favicon.
7. package.json
    - Blueprint/manifest for your project.
    - Contains project info (name, version), dependencies, and npm scripts.
    - Example:
{
"name": "my-app",
"dependencies": {
"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-dom": "^18.2.0"
},
"scripts": {
"dev": "vite",
"build": "vite build"
}
}
8. package-lock.json
    - Automatically generated by npm.
    - Locks the exact versions of dependencies for reliable, repeatable installs.
9. README.md
    - Documentation file in Markdown, with setup instructions and project details.
10. vite.config.js
    - Vite configuration file. Used for plugins, aliases, and build options.
    - Example for alias:
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
export default defineConfig({
plugins: [react()],
resolve: {
alias: {
'@': '/src'
}
}
})

Quick Summary
-------------
- node_modules/ – All installed packages, managed by npm.
- public/ – Static files (copied directly).
- src/ – Source code, components, assets, styles.
    * assets/ – Images, fonts, etc., imported in code.
    * components/ – Reusable UI elements.
    * features/ – Feature logic (auth, products).
    * hooks/ – Custom hooks.
    * pages/ – Top-level page components.
    * layouts/, services/, store/, styles/ – Optional functional folders.
    * App.jsx, App.css, index.css, main.jsx – Core files for app startup.
- .gitignore – Files/folders Git will ignore.
- eslint.config.js – Code rules/settings.
- index.html – Main HTML page to mount React.
- package.json – Project info, dependencies, scripts.
- package-lock.json – Exact dependency versions for consistency.
- README.md – Project instructions and documentation.
- vite.config.js – Vite build, alias, and plugin settings.

This structure keeps your React + Vite project easy to manage, scalable as features grow, and simple for collaboration and deployment.
